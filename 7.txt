In my perspective, we should follow human behavior rather than strict laws or rules because AI cannot think,
wonder and cannot take an effective decision for the welfare of a human being.

My most saved character is a young man like me because we haven't experienced the cruelty, bitterness, and many things of the world. And
young men carry the future and welfare and development of human beings.
 My most killed character is pets because they are secondary life and existence in our world.
 

will AI cars be the future?

- In every century human beings discovered and invented different machines for the betterment of human beings.
so, all the ancestors carried and spent their life to discovering such machines. Looking at the present situation 
of the world most of the work in the big industry is done by the AI machine which is hard for human beings.
But in terms of AI cars in the present generation, it's hard to understand human thought and emotion to the machine.
In the coming future, next-generation might find the vulnerabilities of AI cars that present human beings cannot find.so, AI
cars carry the future.
