VVI in 7 OS layers.

Data link layer

Network layer topic ma  question auxa...



End Device or Host or Node:

the point where the data are generated or originated.



peer-to-peer -- works as a server as well as client in a same time... torrent



Inrermediary   Network Devices.
 
Router 





Networkd Media 

Metal wires within cables
-- uses electeical signal/impulse

Glass or plastic fibers
--- those medium which uses pulses of light


Wireless transmission
-- thse medium which uses modulation of specific frequencies of electromagnetic waves.

	Common Type of Network

size of the area covered
number of users connected
number and types of services available
area of responsibility

ethernet cable cannot carry the data to the far distance whereas the serial, optical fiber and co-axial can trasnmit the data to the
far distance.

OSI Layer (VVI)

Specified in ISO 7498

Model has 7 layers

2. Data link
1. Physical layer


raw data re compressed / decompressed or enc/dec or encrypt/decrypt


Transport

TCP --> reliable

UDP --> unreliable


Network layer decide what route/path the data should take from source to destination.

Data link deliver the data by hop-to-hop process. Error detection and error correction, flow control.
To indicate the start of data in certain fragment which is in form of binary called framing.
		data starts from 10110101

10101010----10100101 	1010001101
		data1		data2


Physical layer tranform the logical data to the physically in which data is transfer in which medium.
